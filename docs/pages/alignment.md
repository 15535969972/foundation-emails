Just add the class center any element and you’ll be good to go. Inky will handle the magic behind the scenes! In the regular old CSS version, you’d have to fiddle with adding a “.text-center” class and a <code>&lt;center&gt;</code> tag to make sure things are centered. Now you just just need to add the class and move on ahead!
